TApp Team Project LC01-LB01-A Web Application

## Aims and Objectives

A rental e-bike is a vehicle that can be used by anyone for a temporary period or for traveling a short distance. The project aims to provide pay-as-you-go E-bike renting via the webpage. Customers should be able to locate nearby stations and find vehicles that are available for use. After the usage, the customer should be able to return the vehicle to the nearby station and pay the charges. To accomplish that the following objectives must be met:
- Develop a webpage which can be used for booking, payment and reporting defective vehicle services.
- The Operators should be able to track the location of the vehicle, find a defective vehicle and move vehicle to a different station.
- Managers should be able to generate reports over a period to understand and improve the business process.
- Build a database to store customer details, vehicle details, station details and operator details.
